# Cup Content Switcher â€“ JavaScript DOM 

This project demonstrates how to switch the content between cups (teh, kopi, kosong) using plain JavaScript and DOM manipulation.

The logic identifies which cups contain a drink and which one is empty, then allows the user to transfer the content from a filled cup to the empty one by clicking.
